# AgriScope - Agricultural Monitoring Platform

A comprehensive agricultural monitoring and management platform that leverages satellite data, weather analytics, and field management tools to help farmers optimize crop management and monitor field conditions.

## üåæ Project Overview

AgriScope combines **satellite imagery analysis**, **real-time weather monitoring**, and **field management** into a unified platform. The application uses Google Earth Engine for NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) calculations, NASA's weather APIs for meteorological data, and interactive mapping for field boundary management.

- **Python Flask Server** (Port 5000): Google Earth Engine integration for satellite data processing
- **MySQL Database**: User data, field boundaries, and plot information

### Frontend
- **React Application** (Port 3000): Interactive UI with mapping, charts, and data visualization
- **Leaflet Maps**: Interactive field drawing and NDVI visualization
- **Chart.js**: Time-series data visualization for NDVI and weather trends
